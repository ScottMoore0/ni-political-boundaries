# Northern Ireland political boundaries
## Collecting largescale vector maps of the political boundaries of Northern Ireland, at local, Stormont and Westminster level, now and historically.
### Westminster boundaries
These boundaries are used in Westminster elections and for elections to Northern Ireland-wide bodies (in modern times, the Northern Ireland Assembly).

Note that these boundaries are the Westminster boundaries for Northern Ireland only, with no boundaries provided outside of Northern Ireland. In a couple of instances, there were changes made to boundaries in Britain, while the boundaries in Northern Ireland remained unchanged.

These boundaries are sourced from parlconst.org and from OSNI.

- 2023 boundaries (used in the 2024 UK general election)
- 2008 boundaries (used in the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 UK general elections; and in the 2011, 2016, 2017 and 2022 Assembly elections)
- 1995 boundaries (used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 UK general elections; in the 1996 Northern Ireland Forum election; and in the 1998, 2003 and 2007 Assembly elections)
- 1982 boundaries (used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 UK general elections)
- 1970 boundaries (used in the February 1974, October 1974, and 1979 UK general elections; in the 1973 and 1982 Assembly elections; and in the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention election)
- 1948 boundaries (used in the 1950, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1964, 1966 and 1970 UK general elections)
- 1920 boundaries (used in the 1922, 1923, 1924, 1929, 1931, 1935 and 1945 UK general elections; and in the 1921 and 1925 Parliament of Northern Ireland election)
- 1918 boundaries (predating the existence of Northern Ireland)
- 1885 boundaries (predating the existence of Northern Ireland)

### Local government boundaries
Since 1973, council boundaries include Local Government Districts (LGDs), which represent the external boundary of each of the councils; District Electoral Areas (DEAs), which are multi-member districts which each elect numerous councillors via the single transferable vote system of proportional representation; and Electoral Wards, the basic building blocks of DEAs, LGDs and Parliamentary constituencies. 

All Parliamentary constituencies and DEAs are made up of a combination of Electoral Wards, such that the Electoral Wards nest exactly within them at the time the Parliamentary constituencies, DEAs are drawn. The number of councillors which represent a given DEA is based on the number of Electoral Wards contained within that DEA - e.g. if a DEA is made up of five Electoral Wards, then the DEA will have five councillors, elected by and representing the entire area of the DEA.

The 2012 and 1993 boundaries are sourced from OSNI.

- 2012 boundaries (used in the 2014, 2019 and 2023 local government elections, and whose Electoral Wards were used to build the 2023 Parliamentary constituencies; the set of boundaries which introduced the system of 11 councils)
- 1993 boundaries (used in the 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2011 local government elections, and whose Electoral Wards were used to build the 1997 and 2008 Parliamentary constituencies)
- 1985 boundaries (used in the 1985 and 1989 local government elections)
- 1973 boundaries (used in the 1973, 1977 and 1981 local government elections; the set of boundaries which introduced the system of 26 councils)

From 1923 until 1973, council boundaries comprised the Administrative Counties, meaning the six traditional counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry* and Tyrone, plus the two county boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry* (centred on those cities and taking some territory from adjacent traditional counties), such that the traditional counties formed a top tier of local government and the county boroughs existed as unitary authorities combining upper- and lower-tier competences; Districts and Boroughs, meaning all urban districts, all rural districts and the two county boroughs, such that the urban and rural districts formed the lower tier of local government, with all urban and rural districts nesting exactly into the Administrative Counties; District Electoral Divisions, from which one or multiple councillors/aldermen were elected to urban districts, rural districts and county boroughs by First Past The Post or the bloc vote system, and which formed the building blocks of Parliament of Northern Ireland constituencies from 1929 onwards and of County Electoral Divisions; Electoral Wards, which were almost always coterminous with the boundaries of District Electoral Division besides a handful of exceptional cases; and County Electoral Divisions, made up of multiple District Electoral Divisions and serving as the unit from which county councillors were elected.

- 1923 boundaries
- Various set of boundaries in the interim with incremental, localised changes - ideally, I'd like to have a map for every set of boundaries that was used in an election or a by-election
- The boundaries as they were immediately prior to the 1973 changes

*As named in the data.

## Complete:
- Westminster Parliamentary constituencies in the area covering Northern Ireland, from 1885 to 2023 (present boundaries). Note that these boundaries have also been used for all post-1973 elections to Northern Ireland-wide bodies (the Assembly, the Forum, the Constitutional Convention), and also for the 1921 and 1925 Parliament of Northern Ireland elections.
- Local government boundaries from 1993 to 2012 (present boundaries).

## To do.
- Local government boundaries for the 26 councils.
- - 1985 boundaries (Local Government Districts, District Electoral Areas, Wards). The legislation simply refers to OS maps of boundaries available for inspection from the Public Records Office, rather than explicitly describing the boundaries.
  - 1973 boundaries (Local Government Districts, District Electoral Areas, Wards). The legislation contains lists of wards and the townlands which make them up (though not all are exact combinations of whole townlands - some townlands, esp. in urban areas, are split by ward boundaries. In some cases, wards coincide exactly with old District Electoral Divisions, urban districts, etc, and this is stated if this is the case.
- Local government boundaries for the old councils between 1924 (the first Northern Ireland council election) and 1973.
- - Boundaries were first set in 1923.
  - No sweeping changes on the scale of 1973 or 2014 were made between 1923 and 1973 - only smaller, localised changes. So it would be sensible to determine the 1923 boundaries, and then determine an exhaustive list of localised changes prior to 1973, and map these out. e.g. creation of Kilkeel Urban District(?), creation of unified Fermanagh council in 1967, creation of Craigavon council in late 1960s, etc.
  - District Electoral Divisions are fundamental. Many are made up of combinations of townlands, without any townlands being split across DEDs (though this is not true in all cases, particularly in urban areas). All urban districts, rural districts, county boroughs and county electoral divisions are made up of DEDs, and DEDs nest perfectly within all of these. For each rural district, the Belfast Gazette (findable online) contains a list of its DEDs, and a list of the townlands (and in some cases, small and sometimes unnamed islands which don't belong to townlands) that make up each one.
  - I reviewed results for a Belfast County Borough election in 1967 and it suggested a distinction between the election of an alderman and the election of councillors for a given ward. I will seek further clarity on what this means. In modern times 'alderman' status is ceremonial and conferred upon councillors by vote of a council.
  - The District Electoral Divisions originate from the Poor Law Electoral Divisions (either the divisions proper and/or their intersections with municipal boundaries), but their boundaries were different between 1901, 1911 and 1923. Many online resources re: District Electoral Divisions refer to 1901 or 1911 DEDs, rather than 1923 DEDs.
- Parliament of Northern Ireland constituencies, 1929-1969.
- - These appear to nest exactly within the Administrative Counties, and many are made up of combinations of District Electoral Divisions. i.e. if we get the DEDs mapped out, then many of the Parliament of NI constituencies can be gotten quickly by simply combining DEDs together.
  - The four Belfast constituencies appear to nest exactly within Belfast County Borough.
  - Note that the Parliament of Northern Ireland constituencies of 1921 and 1925 are identical to the Westminster constituencies of that period.
- Parliament of Northern Ireland constituencies, 1969-1973.
- - Only one election held under these boundaries in 1969.
  - Largely identical to the 1929 Parliament of Northern Ireland boundaries, except for four new constituencies near Belfast.
